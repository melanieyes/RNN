#Project Overview

This project focuses on building and comparing different Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures. Four models were developed to evaluate their performance in terms of test accuracy and training time. The models include LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional GRU, and Bidirectional LSTM.

Models Overview

LSTM Model

Test Accuracy: 0.8682

Training Time: 98.35 seconds

GRU Model

Test Accuracy: 0.8723

Training Time: 84.75 seconds

Bidirectional GRU Model

Test Accuracy: 0.8779

Training Time: 103.18 seconds

Bidirectional LSTM Model

Test Accuracy: 0.8676

Training Time: 187.65 seconds

Comparison of Models

The four models were compared based on their test accuracy and the time taken to train them. The Bidirectional GRU model showed the highest test accuracy (0.8779), whereas the GRU model had the shortest training time (84.75 seconds).

Key Insights

Best Accuracy: The Bidirectional GRU model achieved the highest test accuracy of 0.8779, making it the most effective model in this comparison.

Training Efficiency: The GRU model was the most efficient in terms of training time, taking only 84.75 seconds.

Trade-offs: The Bidirectional LSTM model, despite being complex, had slightly lower accuracy (0.8676) and the longest training time (187.65 seconds).
